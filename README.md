# AquaQA

AquaQA is a platform for digital, online EMS quality assurance. It's designed for review of prehospital care reports, and it takes the place of paper QA sheets. It also incorporates some nice technologies to make all credentialed members' lives easier.

The application allows for configurable QA questions, automatic alerts based on settable criteria, and a host of other features. Eventually, it will provide members for whom charts were reviewed daily summaries of their newly reviewed charts, and it will provide designated officers daily summaries of all newly reviewed charts.

### Technologies

Aqua is being developed using Angular 6 and Node 10. We recommend using MariaDB for your relational database needs.

### How to run

Run `npm install` and then `npm start` while in the `/angular` directory.
