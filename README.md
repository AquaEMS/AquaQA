# Aqua
Aqua is the digital RPI **A**mbulance **Qu**ality **A**surance system. It takes the place of paper QA sheets, and it incorporates some nice technologies to make all credentialed members' lives easier.

The application allows for configurable QA questions, automatic alerts based on settable criteria, and a host of other features. Eventually, it will provide members for whom charts were reviewed daily summaries of their newly reviewed charts, and it will provide designated officers daily summaries of all newly reviewed charts.

### Technologies
Aqua is being developed using Angular 6 and Node 10. We recommend using MariaDB for your relational database needs.
